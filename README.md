Conducted exploratory data analysis and data processing of missing values and the outliers through log transformation
Implemented different algorithms, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, used GridSearchCV to get optimal hyperparameters,
Used Stratified k-fold cross validation (k=5) to check the robustness; concluded LDA performs best with 81.2% precision
